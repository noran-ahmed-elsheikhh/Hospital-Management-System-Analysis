## **Project Overview Summary :-**

---
This project is a comprehensive Hospital Management System database designed to efficiently manage hospital operations, including patient records, appointments, medical treatments, surgeries, appointments and billing. The database supports a wide range of hospital functions and provides valuable insights through data analysis.We have dropped tables from schema which are unnecessary in our visualization. We have added numerical columns in each table so we can make measures to use in our dashboard. We have created 4 dashboards analyzing all important points in our prespective.
